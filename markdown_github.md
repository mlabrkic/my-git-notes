## [Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) for writing on GitHub

#### Introduction

Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text.<br>
You can use Markdown syntax, along with some additional **HTML tags**, to format your writing on GitHub, in places like repository READMEs and comments on pull requests and issues.


#### Creating or editing your profile README

For more information, see "[Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme#adding-a-profile-readme)."


#### Adding an image to suit your visitors

For more information, see "[Managing your theme settings](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/managing-your-theme-settings)."<br>
For more information on using images in Markdown, see "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images)."

#### Adding a table

When a table column contains numbers, it's useful to right-align the column by using the syntax --: below the header row.

Hi, I'm Mona. You might recognize me as GitHub's mascot.

| Rank | Languages |
|-----:|-----------|
|     1| Javascript|
|     2| Python    |
|     3| SQL       |


#### Adding a collapsed section

To keep your content tidy, you can use the `<details>` tag to create an expandible collapsed section.

<details>
<summary>My top languages</summary>

| Rank | Languages |
|-----:|-----------|
|     1| Javascript|
|     2| Python    |
|     3| SQL       |

</details>


#### Adding a quote

Here, you'll add a horizontal rule to divide your page and a blockquote to format your favorite quote.

---
> If we pull together and commit ourselves, then we can push through anything.

â€” Mona the Octocat


#### Adding a comment

You can use HTML comment syntax to add a comment that will be hidden in the output. Here, you'll add a comment to remind yourself to update your README later.

<!-- TO DO: add more details about me later -->


#### Saving your work
